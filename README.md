# Citrus-Disease-Detection

Deep learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized the detection of diseases in agriculture, allowing for automated and precise classification. This paper introduces a MobileNetV2-based deep learning model for real-time citrus disease detection. Based on high-resolution images obtained from Kaggle, the model classifies citrus leaves and fruits into four classes: greening (Huanglongbing), black spot, citrus canker, and healthy. Model generalization is enhanced by data augmentation strategies, and performance is improved by optimization techniques like categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. Comparative analysis with InceptionV3 and customized CNNs portrays the high accuracy and efficiency of MobileNetV2. A web application enables real-time disease identification and provides information on symptoms, causes, and prevention strategies. This study aids precision agriculture by minimizing human intervention and enhancing disease management. Future upgrades include hyperspectral imaging, edge computing, and Explainable AI for intelligent farming solutions.
